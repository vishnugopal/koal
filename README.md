# Koal

Koal makes reading the works of _amateur fiction writers_ easy & friendly on mobiles. Currently, _good_ amateur writing is spread across multiple websites & newsgroups on the Internet, places that are hard to find, and sites that were built in the 90s. Koal provides a simple, clean and modern interface to such writing.

You do not need to login to use Koal, and it's also completely free to use. Start here: [koal.io](https://koal.io/).

Current Status: **Extremely WIP**, nothing works yet!

## Development

Koal is built using [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) & the [Stimulus JS](https://stimulusjs.org/) frameworks.

Koal's deployment is on a Digital Ocean server, and uses PostgreSQL as its database. There is also an importer available in bin/ that imports books & chapters in DOCX or EPUB formats.
