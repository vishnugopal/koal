    <h1>Koal</h1>
    <p>Koal collects the best of amateur writing in one simple, mobile-friendly website.</p>
    <p>All stories here are curated, “best of the best” collections from years of reading amateur fiction from the nooks & corners of the internet. Many stories are now hard to find & only available on obscure sites or newsgroups, or behind paywalls. This is an effort to consolidate all of them in a single place, and also build a beautiful reading experience to enjoy these timeless words.</p>
